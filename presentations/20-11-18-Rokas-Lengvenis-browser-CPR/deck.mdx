1. Blocking cases
1. Optimisations

## Browser Objects

1. DOM
1. CSSOM
1. JavaScript

---

## DOM
<img src='https://goo.gl/SP6Wbo' alt="Image alt" />

- Build incrementally
- `DOMContentLoaded` - DOM created (external resources not loaded)
- `load` - all resources loaded

```notes
- Intrementally - no need to parse whole dock before starting to construct DOM
```

---

## CSS
<img src='https://goo.gl/LxYkQH' alt="Image alt" />

- Not build incrementally, due to possible overrides
- Doens't block DOM building
- Blocks JS fetching and execution
- Blocks Render Tree creation

---

## JavaScript
<img src='https://goo.gl/eXtuHk' alt="Image alt" />

- Fetch and execution blocks DOM building
- Execution will be blocked by CSSOM creation
- Speculative parsing might prefech some resources

---

## Page Rendering
	Bytes => Characters => Tokens  
		=> DOM, CSSOM, JS 
			=> Render Tree (only visible stuff)
				=> Layout (reflow)
					=> Paint phase 

---

## Blocking example I
<img src='https://goo.gl/cbGbjA' alt="Image alt" />

- Fetch will block DOM parsing and building
- No img and other resources further in doc will be detected and fetched

---

## Blocking example II
<img src='https://goo.gl/bYnQgY' alt="Image alt" />

- CSS is not blocking DOM parsing (only Render Tree building)
- Blocks JS fetching
- JS blocks DOM building

---

## Optimizations

---

## Speculative parsing

- IE - "The lookahead downloader", Safari, Chrome - "The preload scanner"
- While JS is fetched and executed DOM is speculatively parsed further and resources prefeched in a background
- In FF even DOM is build speculatively

---

## use rel="preload" 
 - Speculative parsing doesn't deal in the best way by itself
 - Use for preloading img, and other external resources
 - Not only for scripts, ex: `style`, `image`, `font` , `audio`, `video`

---
### Non optimised

### Optimised
<img src='https://goo.gl/mbi3Sw' alt="Image alt" />

---

## use "defer"
<img src='https://goo.gl/LAcfPG' alt="Image alt" />

- Fetch will not block DOM parsing
- Will execute 'defered' only when DOM is constructed before DOMContentLoaded event
- Scripts executed in order they appear in code

```notes
- The second option to use. Use `defer` only if there is dependency between scripts
```

---

## use "async"
<img src='https://goo.gl/w7UzFr' alt="Image alt" />

 - Fetch will not block DOM parsing
 - Execute at first opportunity after fetched before `load` event is called
 - No script order is guaranteed
 - Will block DOM building
